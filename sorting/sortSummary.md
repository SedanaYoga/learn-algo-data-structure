## Bubble Sort

This only used for educational purposes

## Insertion Sort

useful if the data is nearly sorted, it can be fast

## Selection Sort

mostly used for education purposes

## Merge Sort

This have O(n log(n)), so it fast, this applies for Best till Worst case
If you worried about about worst case scenario, you should consider using merge sort
NOTE: trade-off here is the space complexity O(n)

## Quick Sort

This is type of sort that is mostly used.
The space complexity is better than merge sort
But, the trade-off here is in the worst case
since it randomly picks the pivot

## Non-Comparison Sort

It is not using comparison to sort between elements, but not suitable for data type unless number

- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort
